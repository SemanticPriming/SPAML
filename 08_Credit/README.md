# Credit Folder

This folder was used to combine all relevant sources of information to make our tenzing document. 

- `check_tenzing.Rmd`: reads in data sources from our tracking platform (Canvas), and outputs the `final_tenzing.xlsx` file used for our Author List found in the manuscript folder. 
- `final_tenzing_clean.xlsx`: our final version of the tenzing chart with some hand edits for name issues and such.
- `author_yaml.txt` is the exported authorship structure to use in `print_title.Rmd` using the *papaja* package to create the title page for the manuscript.
