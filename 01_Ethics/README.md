# Ethics Information

Individual ethics requirements for each lab can be found here: <https://osf.io/ycn7z/>

Here is a link to an overall document that shows the PI, teams, and summarized ethics documents here: [Lab Summary](https://github.com/SemanticPriming/SPAML/blob/master/05_Data/summary_tables/irb_lab_summary.csv)

File information:

-   `Ethics_Packet.docx` was giving to teams to help them fill out their IRB. Note that we were approved to do other tasks but decided to concentrate on the priming task only.
-   `Recruitment_Materials.docx` were created to help recruit teams into the project.

The rest of the documents are IRB information from Harrisburg University:

-   Each document labeled `_Approval` indicates an approval to an update or the original IRB.
-   Each document is labeled with `_Modification` or `_Extension` were updates to the original IRB.
-   Each document is versioned with V1, V2, etc.
-   The V2 full document is a combination of V1 application + V2 modification to help teams put together their IRBs. These were both done before anyone else started their IRB applications.
