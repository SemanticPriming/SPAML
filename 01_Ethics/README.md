# Ethics Information

Each participating laboratory was responsible for obtaining ethics approval for data collection, possibly through a reliance on the IRB approval at Harrisburg University. Individual ethics requirements for each lab can be found here: <https://osf.io/ycn7z/> A document with links to each participating lab's approval and other associated methods-related information is here: [Lab Summary](https://osf.io/ty4hp).

File information:

-   `Ethics_Packet.docx` was given to teams to help them complete their IRB application. Note that we were approved to include other tasks but decided to concentrate on the priming task only.
-   `Recruitment_Materials.docx` were created to help recruit teams into the project.

The remainder of the documents are IRB information from Harrisburg University, with the following notes:

-   Each document labeled `_Approval` indicates an approval to the original IRB application or updates to it.
-   Each document labeled with `_Modification` or `_Extension` is an update to the original IRB.
-   Each document is versioned with V1, V2, etc.
-   The V2 full document is a combination of V1 application + V2 modification to help teams put together their IRBs. These were both completed at Harrisburg before participating labs started their IRB applications.
