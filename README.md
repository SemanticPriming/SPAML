# Folder Information

Please see readme files within in each folder for more information about individual files within each folder. 

`01_Ethics`: This folder contains all the information about the overall Ethics from Harrisburg University. Please see https://osf.io/ycn7z/ for ethics from individual research labs. 

`02_Power`: This folder contains the power analysis simulations for the proposal paper. 

`03_Materials`: This folder contains the materials and translations for the languages that we ran the study in. 

`04_Procedure`: This folder contains example versions of the experiment and all materials for setting up the experiment on your own php enabled server. 

`05_Data`: This folder contains the template for data processing from raw data into the analysis data. Note that we may store the data files in on GitHub in a release if they become too large. 

`06_Analysis`: This folder contains the files that calculate descriptive statistics, hypothesis tests, and transition probabilities. 

`07_Manuscript`: This folder contains manuscript drafts, author lists, and contributions made by each author. 

`08_Credit`: Finalized credit information will be stored in this folder. 

`09_PSA_Proposal`: This folder contains the original submission to the PSA. The power analyses were the same and moved to the overall power folder. Between original submission and submission to the journal, updated similarity calculations were included, and therefore, the original versions are only in this folder. 

`10_Presentations`: This folder contains the information for presentations given about the project. 

`11_Grants`: This folder contains information about grants we submitted to support this project.

*Note*: We believe everyone who contributed to this project should get credit. For the 2021 presentations, we listed contributors under the Psychological Science Accelerator because conference submission systems have not caught up to big team science. E. Buchanan is the corresponding author. K. Cucculo and S. Lewis are part of the admin team. All other contributors are listed in a random order who have assisted in data processing at the time of the presentation of these two works.
