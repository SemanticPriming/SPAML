Information about files in this folder:

- `power_aipe.Rmd`: This file is the markdown version of our power analyses. You can recreate our power analysis with the note that different seeds will create slightly different numbers. The file is annotated to be readable somewhat separately from our manuscript.
- `power_aipe.pdf`: The PDF version of our power analysis knitted for reviewing. 
- `ELPDecisionData.zip`: Lexical decision data from the English Lexicon Project (Balota et al., 2007) used in the power analysis.
